# Monochrome Dream Classification

Code for Kaggle contest in which competitors have to train machine learning models on a data set containing images dreamed by deep generative models.

I have implemented two models: SVM (Support Vector Machine) - 0.7526 accuracy and CNN (Convolutional Neuronal Network) - 0.909 accuracy.

The models were trained on 30.000 images and tested on 5.000 images.
